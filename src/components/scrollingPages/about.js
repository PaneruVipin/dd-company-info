          We are a diverse, international team of around 100 young volunteers
          with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. We are united by a
          belief in climate solutions, through policy reform as well as
          individual and collective action. Through enabling a deep
          understanding of climate policy, we want to amplify young peopleâ€™s
          voices and spark positive change around the world!
