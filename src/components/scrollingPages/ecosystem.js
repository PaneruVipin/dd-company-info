    We are a diverse, international team of around 100 young volunteers
    with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. We are united by a
    belief in climate solutions, through policy reform as well as
    individual and collective action. Through enabling a deep
    understanding of climate policy, we want to amplify young peopleâ€™s
    voices and spark positive change around the world!
